// Add functions you want to export in the table below (+ related #include on

// a prefix like "SWS_", "FNG_", etc.
// Your functions must be made dumb-proof, they must not trust any parameter.
// However, your do not need to ValidatePr() REAPER pointer parameters (such as 
// MediaTrack*, MediaItem*, etc): REAPER does this for you when a script runs
// an exported function.
// REAPER pointer parameters are validated against the prior ReaProject* param,
// (or the current project if absent/NULL). For ex., in the following function:
// void bla(ReaProject* p1, MediaTrack* t1, ReaProject* p2, MediaItem* i2),
// t1 will be validated against p1, but i2 will be validated against p2.
// Your must interpret NULL ReaProject* params as "the current project".
//
// When defining/documenting API function parameters:
//  - if a (char*,int) pair is encountered, name them buf, buf_sz
//  - if a (const char*,int) pair is encountered, buf, buf_sz as well
//  - if a lone basicType *, use varNameOut or varNameIn or
//    varNameInOptional (if last parameter(s))
// At the moment (REAPER v5pre6) the supported parameter types are:
//  - int, int*, bool, bool*, double, double*, char*, const char*
//  - AnyStructOrClass* (handled as an opaque pointer)
// At the moment (REAPER v5pre6) the supported return types are:

Julian remarks:

Under the hood, REAPER converts all ReaScript API functions to this standard format before calling the C++ function:
	void* func(void** arglist, int numparams)

So all functions must either be in this format, or get a wrapper function such as this:
	static void* __vararg_TEST_Window_GetRect(void** arglist, int numparms)
	{
	return (void*)(INT_PTR)TEST_Window_GetRect((void*)arglist[0], (int*)arglist[1], (int*)arglist[2], (int*)arglist[3], (int*)arglist[4]);
	}

In the REAPER IDE, the user doesn't need to type such a strange-looking vararg function.  Instead, the user can type standard Lua functions.
	The names and types of the parameters and return values that the user sees in the IDE are registered by plugin_register(APIdef_...).

In the case of int, bool and void* parameters and return values, these values are stored in the void* variable itself.  

In the case of doubles, the sizeof(double) is larger than sizeof(void*), so cannot be stored in a void* parameter.  
		Instead, the void* argument is a pointer to the actual double value: *(double*)arglist[1]
		Similarly, a double return value should be stored in the *
		If you want to return a double value, don't return it as the C++ function's return value. Instead, include a "double* myVariableOut" in the arguments,
